## Game Overview

The game consists of various levels that teach programming concepts using pseudocode. It is aimed at beginners, providing an interactive and engaging way to learn the fundamentals of programming. Here’s an overview:

1. **Menu**: Choose from "Continue", "New Game", and "Quit Game". The game saves automatically in a JSON file after entering a new room.

7. **Levels**: In order to progress, the player must solve different puzzles related to the different programming concepts that the levels are focused on. Each level introduces a new concept through a text explanation. Whenever they need help, the player can visualise these explanations again by clicking the blue **`?`** button on the screen. The levels of the game include:

   - **Variables**: The player can play around and get used to the controlls while observing that each time they defeat a slime, the **`slimes`** variable goes up on the screen.
